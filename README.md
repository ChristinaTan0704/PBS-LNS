# PBS
A suboptimal solver for Multi-Agent Path Finding

Priority-Based Search (PBS) is an efficient suboptimal algorithm for solving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF).
More details can be found in the paper at AAAI 2021 [1].

This implementation is not the original code for producing the results in the paper.
It contains only the PBS algorithm. The SIPP option for the low-level search of PBS is still under development.

The code requires the external library BOOST (https://www.boost.org/). After you installed BOOST and downloaded the source code, go into the directory of the source code and compile it with CMake: 
```
cmake .
make
```

You also need to download the MAPF instances from the MAPF benchmark (https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf/index.html).

Then, you are able to run the code:
```
./pbs -m random-32-32-20.map -a random-32-32-20-random-1.scen -o test.csv --outputPaths=paths.txt -k 50 -t 60
```

- m: the map file from the MAPF benchmark
- a: the scenario file from the MAPF benchmark
- o: the output file that contains the search statistics
- outputPaths: the output file that contains the paths 
- k: the number of agents
- t: the runtime limit

You can find more details and explanations for all parameters with:
```
./pbs --help
```
